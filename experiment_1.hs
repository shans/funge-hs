 (there's still a hang somewhere. For example, "9-c:pd{$j." hangs. Looks like it's because this jumps to -4 with a delta of 1, and I don't handle forward out-of-bounds yet. Fixed.)

 1000 100 -> 22.8% 22.5% 23.8%

 10000 100 -> 
 (hangs on "?3d5s2+gb+". Or doesn't. Hmm. Ah - occasionally an InputDecimal command is inserted and executed (randomness due to '?'). Added an option for accepting user input.)
 (hangs on "b}-{6 a,:9". This looks like it demonstrates 2 bugs. (1) "b}" shouldn't push into the stack frame as endBlock should have no effect on a single-entry stack stack.
     (2) EndBlock on [-1, 11, 11, 0, 0] [0, 0, ....] hangs. I suspect this is because of the -1 at the top of the stack. Both fixed.)
 ("-'p?%:+.\"{" -> Exception: Prelude.chr: bad argument (-45). Wait, shouldn't StringMode load the String on the stack? Shouldn't BeginBlock always push another stack frame?
 Ah, these are being traced in StringMode. So the issue is encountering the Reverse (-45) while in StringMode. Looks OK now.)
 (hangs on "]npw`k*pd\"". Actually this doesn't hang! It's just incredibly slow because it introduces a ridiculously sparse IP space.)
 (hangs on "}${*k/1'\"8". Again it doesn't.)

 ("*,?'*\"2wa*" -> Prelude.chr: bad argument: 2424030000. Largest 'chr' input is 1114111. Fix outputCharacter.
 ("?5bP*,r*;f" -> Prelude.chr: bad argument: 9397265625. Need to fix Print too. Print actually shouldn't be in the standard set of characters... removing. Can test
  sensitivity in a different run.)

The problem is the TurnRight at [3,9] ( we go [0,0] [1,0] [2,0] ^ [2,9] [2,8] [2,7] x(1,2) [3,9] ). Turning right should make this [-2,1] so the next instruction should be [1,10]. 
This is out of bounds so we need to backTrack - to [3,9], then [5,8], then [7,7], then [9,5] which should be the next instruction. That's an 'r' or Reverse which should execute.

Wow. MISTAKE in LeftOf. Might need to run some prior runs again to confirm results.

at [3,9] heading [0,-1] JumpForward(-2). This will take us to [3,11] which will update to [3,10] and should then be [3,9] again.

Minimal model: /2-^?j?j. Exhibits same problem. 
pointingTowards [3,2] [0,-1] [(0,4),(0,2)] returns False, but should return True. Stupid out-by-one.
